    <h1>About My Summer 2016 Trip</h1>

<p>I am currently a junior at the University of Miami majoring in Journalism with a minor in Urban Studies. My focus and passion is in pursuing a career in video journalism.</p>
<p>I gained valuable travel experience and insights the summer of 2016 traveling to South Africa, Namibia, and Thailand for classes, volunteer work, and solo traveling. While in South Africa I stayed at Mouille Point, Cape Town, where me and a group of other students volunteered at the The Amy Biehl Foundation, helping at the Siyazingisa Primary School in the Guguletu township, as well as traveling to different spots around the country. Following South Africa, the group headed off to Namibia where we stayed in the town of Windhoek where we explored dunes and, if you chose to, went skydiving (I did). After Windhoek the group headed to the Erindi Private Game Reserve for a few days of a safari seeing magnificent animals.</p>
     <p>Once that coursework was completed, I traveled alone for two weeks throughout Thailand where I spent my time meeting people, undertaking different daily adventures, and reflecting on my professional goal in life to travel and document the lives and stories of those whose voices are not heard by the mainstream world. This solo traveling was one of the best experiences  of my life and I hope to be fortunate enough to continue traveling for my career in the future.</p>
